# Homebrew formula for the `fno` CLI - the brew install channel (ab-d59d219a).
#
# This is the canonical source of the formula. It is copied verbatim into the
# own tap repo (github.com/<owner>/homebrew-fno) so `brew install <owner>/fno/fno`
# resolves it. Keeping the source here lets CI parse + audit it and lets the
# brew clean-machine smoke (cli/tests/smoke/brew_formula_smoke.sh) prove the
# install + symlink mechanism against a freshly built local wheel.
#
# The "py-wheel flywheel" (shared with the cargo + fno.sh channels): `fno` is the
# Python Typer CLI and only `fno-agents{,-daemon,-worker}` are Rust, so the
# formula installs the published PyPI *platform wheel* (which already bundles all
# three binaries as wheel `shared_scripts`) into a brew-managed venv. brew
# provides Python (depends_on "python@3.13"); the wheel is the single artifact
# source. brew owns the venv + symlinks, so `brew uninstall`/`brew upgrade` are
# clean (Locked Decisions 2 + 3).
#
# LAUNCH GATE: satisfied for 0.2.1 on both macOS arches. `fno` 0.2.1 is
# published to PyPI (the shared gate with cargo + fno.sh), and the arm64 +
# x86_64 `url` + `sha256` below are the real published wheels (kept in lockstep
# on every release bump). The x86_64 macOS wheel is cross-built on the macos-14
# runner (the native Intel macos-13 image is retired); see release-wheels.yml.
#
# Deps: an own-tap formula installs with network, so `pip install` resolves the
# Python deps from PyPI at install time. (Vendoring deps as offline `resource`
# blocks via `brew update-python-resources fno` is a future hardening only a
# homebrew-core submission would require - out of scope for the own tap.)

  # The x86_64 wheel (macosx_10_12) is the top-level default so a `url` is ALWAYS
  # defined - including on Linux, where the on_macos block is skipped. Homebrew
  # validates url presence at load (before requirements), so without a top-level
  # url a Linuxbrew user would hit a confusing `stable: url is missing` instead
  # of the clean `depends_on :macos` refusal below. arm64 overrides this url (and
  # adds its Sonoma floor) inside on_macos.

  # Both macOS arches ship a wheel; the macOS floor is arch-conditional. The

  # "incompatible wheel" error); the x86_64 default targets macosx_10_12, so
  # Intel needs no extra macOS gate beyond python@3.13's own. `depends_on :macos`
  # refuses Linuxbrew, and the top-level url above makes that refusal the error a
  # Linux user actually sees instead of "url is missing".
